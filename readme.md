This project contains a few Sequences I used, to test skeletal animation in Sequences.

You should know that **Sequences were not made for this purpose**. They're supposed to be used for cutscenes, animations, and UI, not as a replacement for sprites or Spine.

Even these Sequences can't be used with objects (as a replacement for sprites). But if you want to do skeletal animation for cutscenes, then you could surely use Sequences for basic animations.
